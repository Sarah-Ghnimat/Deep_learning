## Deep Learning Project (Team Work)

This project was developed as part of a team and focuses on image classification using deep learning.

Our work included:
- Designing and training CNN models  
- Applying transfer learning using VGG16  
- Evaluating and improving model performance  
- Writing a technical paper summarizing the full workflow and results  

Only the core modeling notebook is included here to highlight the deep learning aspect:

- `VGG16_.ipynb` – Transfer learning using VGG16

Data preprocessing notebooks are intentionally excluded to keep the repository focused on model design and learning techniques.
